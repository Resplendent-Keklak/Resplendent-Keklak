ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Resplendent-Keklak (Erica J. Keklak), an NJIT IE major in both the Newark College of Engineering (NCE) and Albert Dorman Honors College (ADHC). As an IE major my time on GitHub has very little to do with traditional software development and is more about learning to program or storing code I use for research.

I mainly work on website editors for site front-end and UI/UX design and don't upload styles to GitHub, so for many of my repositories you'll be forking the most basic styles for websites. UI/UX isn't my strong suit anyway :) If anything, I be concentrating in other aspects of human-computer interaction in how it relates to IE.

I do not respond quickly to messages on GitHub; please use one of my emails instead. Thanks!
